# python-challenge

In this challenge, I analyze 2 sets of data.

Set 1: PyBank in which profit and loss for a company was analyzed to determine total change, average monthly change, and maximum and minimum change across the data set.

Set 2: Election data was examined to gather the list of candidates who received votes as well as the number and percentage of votes and the winner by popular vote.
